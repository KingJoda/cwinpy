Single detector, software injection (circular polarisation)
=========================================================

Here we compare ``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested`` with ``cwinpy`` in the case of
simulated Gaussian noise from a single detector (H1 in this case) containing a software injected signal with close-to circular polarisation. The parameters being
estimated are :math:`h_0`, :math:`\phi_0`, :math:`\psi` and :math:`\cos{\iota}`, all with uniform priors.

The script for this comparison, using the `CPNest <https://johnveitch.github.io/cpnest/>`_ nested sampling algorithm, is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/single_detector_software_injection_circular.py
   :language: python

This produces the following comparison corner plot (``cwinpy`` in blue and ``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested`` in red):

A comparison of the natural logarithms of the model evidence and noise evidence
are given is shown below:
