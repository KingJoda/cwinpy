Code comparison
###############

Here we document comparisons between the analysis produced using ``cwinpy``
compared with the `LALSuite <https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite>`_ code
``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested``, which is described in
Pitkin et al., `arXiv:1705.08978v1 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08978v1>`_.

The codes will be run on identical data and in configurations that are as
close as possible. Links to the various comparisons are given below:
