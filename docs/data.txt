Heterodyned Data
----------------

A data product used for source parameter inference in the Bayesian targeted
pulsar searches perform by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo
Collaboration is a filtered and band-passed complex time series.

Assuming that the source phase evolution is described by a Taylor expansion
of the form:

.. math::

   \phi(t) = C\left(f_0(t-T_0) + \frac{1}{2}\dot{f}_0(t-T_0)^2 + \dots\right)

where :math:`f_0` is the source rotation frequency, :math:`\dot{f}_0` is the
first frequency derivative (higher order derivatives can be used), :math:`t`
is the time, incorporating any Doppler and relativistic delays, :math:`T_0` is
the time reference epoch, and :math:`C` is an emission mechanism-dependent
scaling factor (often set to 2, for emission from the :math:`l=m=2` quadrupole
mode.)
