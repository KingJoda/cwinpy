Known pulsar parameter estimation
#################################

cwinpy can be used for perform Bayesian inference to estimate the source
parameters of a known pulsar from gravitational-wave observations. To sample
from the joint parameter posterior distributions cwinpy uses the
`bilby <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/>`_ package as an interface to a
variety of stochastic sampling methods.

cwinpy comes with an executable, ``cwinpy_knope``
("knope" = "\ **KNO**\ wn pulsar **P**\ arameter **E**\ stimation"), for performing
this analysis, which tries to emulate, as much as possible, the functionality
from the `LALSuite <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/>`_ code
``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested`` described in [1]_.

There is also an API for running this analysis from within a Python shell or
script as described :ref:`below<API>`.

Running the analysis
--------------------

The script, and :ref:`API`, can be used to perform parameter estimation over
a variety of signal parameter both on real data or simulated data. We will
cover some examples in both cases and show equivalent ways of running the
analysis via the use of: command line arguments to the ``cwinpy_knope`` script;
a configuration files, or the :ref:`API`.
