abstract = {GWpy is a Python software package that provides an intuitive, object-oriented interface through which to access, process, and visualise data from gravitational-wave detectors. GWpy provides a number of new utilities for studying data, as well as an improved user interface for a number of existing tools. The ease-of-use, along with extensive online documentation and examples, has resulted in widespread adoption of GWpy as a basis for Python software development in the international gravitational-wave community.}

abstract = {The LALSuite data analysis libraries, written in C, implement key routines critical to the successful detection of gravitational waves, such as the template waveforms describing the merger of two black holes or two neutron stars. SWIGLAL is a component of LALSuite which provides interfaces for Python and Octave, making LALSuite routines accessible directly from scripts written in those languages. It has enabled modern gravitational-wave data analysis software, used in the first detection of gravitational waves, to be written in Python, thereby benefiting from its ease of development and rich feature set, while still having access to the computational speed and scientific trustworthiness of the routines provided by LALSuite.}
